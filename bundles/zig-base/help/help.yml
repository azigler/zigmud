command: help
body: |
  Search for and display a helpfile. Using this command with the 'search' argument allows you to view all commands with at least a partial command, alias, or keyword match to the provided keyword. Targeting a keyword directly with this command will display the best matching helpfile for it, if found. Many helpfiles provide information about commands and channels, and others explain game mechanics and lore.

  If you are a new player, it's recommended that you read the 'newbie' helpfile.
